						<h3>What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start?</h3>
						<p>Through my experience with IT so far, the area’s that I am most interested in learning more about include coding,
							 cybersecurity, networking, and data management. My interest in IT came to me on a whim, when my friend convinced
							  me to do a cert iii in IT in 2017 – from there, my interest has continued to grow.
						</p>
						<h3>Was there a particular event or person the sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience (if any)</h3>
						<p>Like I said in the previous section, I most likely would have never even begun to think about studying IT if it were
							 not for my friend convincing me to do a Cert iii. Although I haven’t had any career experience in IT, so far,
							 my academic experience includes completing the aforementioned cert iii, undergoing an advanced diploma of computer systems engineering,
							 and now, finally, here I am in my first semester of a Bachelor of Information Technology.
						</p>
						<h3>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</h3>
						<p>My decision to come to RMIT was influenced by several factors. I know and have talked to a few RMIT graduates who have nothing but good things to say about the institution,
							 and on top of that I have heard that the IT course offered here is quite good.
               Outside of exclusively educational reasons, I really enjoy the location of the campus in the city, and moreover I have always wanted to move up to Melbourne,
							 and so choosing a university situated in the city seems like good encouragement to finally follow through.
               Finally, I have always wanted to take an active part of the LGBT community that exists in Melbourne, and so being up in the city more often for university would allow me to take my firsts steps into it.

						</p>
						<h3>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</h3>
						<p>I expect this course to fill in the gaps that I have in IT, as well as allow me to more deeply pursue my specific interests within IT.
							 To that end, looking at the major/minor streams, my future most likely involves either leaning about cybersecurity on a more intimate level,
							 including modern day preventative and reactive cybersecurity method, or I’ll be looking at data management, how data is stored, visualising data and analytics.
							 It’s still early on to know for sure which stream I’ll be committing to, though, and I think I could end up changing my mind at some point.
