				<h2>Take-aways from these results</h2>
				<p>After taking these tests and looking at the results of each, I can confidently say that I think these are accurate and I agree with most of what they are saying about myself with a couple of exceptions in the Myers-Briggs test, but they are only very minor disagreements. For example, while I do agree that I am in general more introverted and take a more passive role within a group, I am able to take charge of a situation or of a team if no one else is putting themselves forward and will usually fill this role comfortably if it does come up. </p>
				<p>My interpretation of these test results leads me to believe that by default, my role within a team will more so take on a follower role where while I am not going to be the one leading the conversation, I would still play an active part in the discussion, and based on these results, I would be a fairly easy person to work with in a group due to my agreeableness. Due to my auditory learning nature, the best way for me to get the ball rolling and start understanding the task at hand in a team environment would be through group meetings where we toss ideas out at each other and see what sticks.</p>
				<p>When forming a team, I should look for people who are able to take charge of a group and start steering it in the right direction, while still being able to take ideas and encourage discussion from the rest of the group. To this end, I believe an ideal group for me would be people who are open to having frequent and extensive written or verbal discussions about our tasks. As an individual within the team, I should look to make a written and typed record of what has been discussed by the group in order to go back and listen, and ensure Iâ€™ve correctly absorbed the information from the meeting. </p>
