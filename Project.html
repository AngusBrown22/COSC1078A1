			<article class="Info">
				<h4>Overview</h4>
				<p>For my project, I would like to create an exercise tracking app that has features akin to a traditional RPG game. The app would function similarly to apps such as Pokémon go or ingress –
					A map screen that you can walk in real life in order to move your character allowing you to have random encounters with enemies, enter different towns in the form of real life gyms or parks,
					form ‘parties’ with your friends and play together, and gain experience as well as gear for your character in order to take on challenges/bosses to progress the games story and take on stronger enemies.
				</p>
				<h4> Motivation</h4>
				<p>The idea behind this project is simple: It is common for people to lack the motivation to get out of the house and be active, be it either by going on walks or going to the gym,
					and through our app, we hope to incentivise our customers/user base by tying the progression of their characters level, gear, and the overall story of the game to how active they are in real life.
					I believe that the user base for an app such as this would be quite high and would encourage a plethora of people to be active for the sake of their character and their personal health.
				</p>
				<h4>Description</h4>
				<p>The idea behind the app follows a similar structure to the likes of Pokémon Go, and we will use commonplace technologies such as GPS, mapping and satellite
					services in conjunction with health and fitness tracking such as pedometers and physical exertion trackers that would function even when the app is closed in order
					to continue making progress within the game itself. The games key features that will aim to draw in an audience would be providing a fun new way to encourage others to get out
					and become active include the customisation and progression of characters and classes, the ability to play with friends, and the ability to progress through an RPG story by
					completing quests, side quests, and defeating bosses, all the while providing classic SNES-like music and pleasing pixel art.
				</p>
				<h5>Characters:</h5>
				<p>The game would offer you a choice from some typical RPG classes: A mage, White mage, Fighter, Warrior, etc with some classes locked behind progression through story or quests offered through the game.
					Every class will bring something unique to battles, making every offer different tool to approach different situations. On top of this, players will be able to interact with and recruit
					different NPC’s into their party. The NPC’s can be found in different towns, joining you willingly upon first meeting you, or requiring you to complete a set of quests to prove yourself
					to them before they decide to go along with you, and some NPC’s will even be found at the end of specific dungeons that will need to be rescued.
				</p>
				<h5>Gampeplay:</h5>
				<p>Walking around in real life on this app will allow the players character to explore the world and the towns, villages and other landmarks that are created corresponding to real life locations.
					 At these locations, the player will be able to shop, heal up at an inn, and at certain locations will be able to progress the main story quest.
					 In between these villages while travelling on the map, the player will be able to get into random encounters, find items on the ground,
					 and occasionally come across random events on the road (a trading caravan being ransacked for example).
				</p>
				<h5>Multiplayer:</h5>
				<p>In order to bring people together to give each other support and experience the games content we will implement a party system, allowing up to 4 people to form a party together.
					 Parties will allow friends to set up accumulative step goals per week, as well as track other party members steps to encourage healthy competition between party members,
					 and at the end of the week if parties reach the shared step goals, rewards in the shape of gear for their characters, as well as extra customization options will be given to each party member,
					 with the overall winner of the step challenge acquiring the best of these rewards.
				   In addition to this, parties will be able to undergo dungeons together that will be represented by real world landmarks, offering exciting challenges and co-op opportunities
				   to friends who play together. Only one party member will have to be at the landmark in order to start the dungeon, but having all party members present at the landmark will grant
				   some minor buffs to each member, making the experience slightly easier.
        </p>
				<h4>Tools & Technologies</h4>
				<p>Ideally, the application would be available on any mobile phone OS as to not alienate any potential users, and to make the creation of the app simpler in this regard,
					 we could use the open-source, cross platform software development kit, Flutter – But there are several other tools available. Other than the obvious programming hardware,
					  we will also require software for creating different assets for the game, namely the art as well as the music that will play in game. For the sprites of the characters,
						 we can use the free online app Piskel or GraphicsGale and for music BeepBox offers a simple way to create chiptune music for free.
				</p>
				<h4>Skills Required</h4>
				<p>For this project to be successful we will need a team of people who have the varied skillset required to create game. That means we’ll need at least a novice musician,
					 capable of producing some nice sounding tunes for our game, an artist who’s able to create pixel art both for characters within the game, and some scenery (towns, dungeons interiors, enemies, etc.).
					  In addition to this we will obviously need some people who are able to code to some degree in order to create the game.
				</p>
				<h4>Outcome</h4>
				<p>If the project is successful, we will have created an app that offers a unique twist on the standard fitness tracking app formula,
					 that will hopefully be able to draw in an audience that would otherwise not think twice about using one.
					 Having a new, fun way to track one’s fitness and general activity throughout the day will encourage a healthier lifestyle and help build good habits
					 for people who are looking for a reason to get up and get more physical while also experiencing the joy of levelling up and gearing up a character alongside friends.
